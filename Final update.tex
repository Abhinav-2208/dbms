\end{center}
\section*{SERVER SIDE COMPONENT : ACTIVE SERVER PAGES}
In the world of web-accessible ASP.NET application Active server pages and Servers occupy a central position between enabled clients and application servers. ASP working in the environment of the web container that provides connection and services. By means of these connections, ASP control the presentation of data derived from operations on database to network-connected clients, This client role is suggested in figure -

   \section*{\textbf{SQL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM}} 
\end{center}
Database systems have become ubiquitous across the computing landscape. This is partly because of the basic facilities offered by database management systems: physical data independence, ACID transaction properties, a high-level query language, stored procedures, and triggers. These facilities permits sophisticated applications to ‘push’ much of their complexity into the database itself. The proliferation of database systems in the mobile and embedded market segments is due, in addition to the features above, to the support for two-way database replication and synchronization offered by most commercial database management systems. Data synchronization technology makes it possible for remote users to both access and update corporate data at a remote, off-site location. With local (database) storage, this can be accomplished even when disconnected from the corporate network.
\\
\\
\begin{center}
   \section*{\textbf{SQL is a Relational DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM}} 
\end{center}
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that lets you create, update, and administer a relational database. Most commercial RDBMS's use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database, although SQL was invented after the development of the relational model and is not necessary for its use.The leading RDBMS products Microsoft's SQL Server. Despite repeated challenges by competing technologies, as well as the claim by some experts that no current RDBMS has fully implemented relational principles, the majority of new corporate databases are still being created and managed with an RDBMS.
\begin{center}
   \section*{\textbf{WEB BASED RDBMS}} 
\end{center}
A database can be understood as a collection of related files. How those files are related depends on the model used. Early models included the hierarchical model (where files are related in a parent/child manner, with each child file having at most one parent file), and the network model (where files are related as owners and members, similar to the network model except that each member file can have more than one owner).
\\
\section*{FUTURE OR RDBMS : }
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data are the values stored in the database. On its own, data means very little.
\item  A database is a collection of tables.
\item Each table contains records, which are the horizontal rows in the table. These are also called tuples.
\item Each record contains fields, which are the vertical columns of the table. These are also called attributes.
\item Fields can be of many different types. There are many standard types, and each DBMS (database management system, such as Oracle or SQL) can also have their own specific types, but generally they fall into at least three kinds - character, numeric and date.
\item The domain refers to the possible values each field can contain (it's sometimes called a field specification).
\item An index is a physical mechanism that improves the performance of a database. Indexes are often confused with keys.
\item A view is a virtual table made up of a subset of the actual tables.
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
   \section*{\textbf{HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SPECIFICATION}} 
\end{center}
The hardware & software specification and environment specifications used by programmers are : 
\\
\section*{HARDWARE : }
\begin{itemize}
    \item Computer system: Standard pc/at compatible with Pentium 3 or Pentium 4 CPU or more.
\item  Primary memory: This Information System works within 1 G.B. if user memory (RAM) addressed by MS windows.
\item Input device:  Mouse & keyboard compatible with PC/ AT, video adapters and   monitors. It is a colored program so better to use a colored monitor.
\item Color monitors for best   performance.
\end{itemize}
\\
\section*{SOFTWARE : }
